the computer will ask for a persons name and give out a sentence, saying hello to the person
peer reviewed by Richard Johnson
This program is coded well and works the way it should. The input for the name works, and the Yes or No input
works the way it should as well. It uses a ToLower to convert the yes or no input to lowercase and make sure
it is consistent. Overall, this is a good project
